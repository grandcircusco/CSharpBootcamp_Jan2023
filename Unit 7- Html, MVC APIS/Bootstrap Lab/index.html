            <p>My name is Justin Jones. I have been with Grand Circus since 2018 on and off. I always knew I would work on computers since I was young. Most of my time was on it. I always had a knack for fixing and creating things on the computer but never coded til highschool.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <p>In my highschool coding class, I didn't learn much. It was copy and paste from the book. But I knew it was what I wanted to do. I went to college for it and began my journey.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <p>In my final semester of Community College, one of my friends asked me to be the TA. I agreed, but quickly realized that my 2 years of College only led up to the first 3 weeks of the class. I sat down and learned all I could about the course while finishing my last semester of college. It was intense but clearly I did well as I'm now a teacher.</p>
